        This function calculates the individual element of the output matrix.
        If follows the matri multiplication algorithm, meaning that it 
        performs element-wise multiplication between a row "x" in matrix_a
        and column "y" in matrix_b and sums the products.

    == Inputs ==
        void* arg_p - this exact value corresponds to which thread this is,
            not as in current thread, but as in absolute count. If it is 
            the 100th thread made, but there are only 5 threads running
            in parallel, arg_p is 99, not 5. Used to calculate the x row
            and y column for the element to be calculated.

    == Outputs ==
        N/A

        This takes an argument from the command line (argv[1]) that corresponds
        to the quantity of threads to be used for the matrix multiplication.
        It calls a function in lab1_IO.c that reads matrix_a and matrix_b from 
        data_input.txt.
        It instantiates a number of threads (at a time) equivalent to the 
        quantity specified by the user, and then joins the threads, repeating 
        this process until all of the elements of the result matrix (global 
        variable int** matrix_c have been calculated)

    == Inputs ==
        int argc - number of command line arguments
